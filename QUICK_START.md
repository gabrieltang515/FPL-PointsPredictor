# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - FPL Predictor v2.0

## What's New? 🎉

Your FPL predictor is now **fully functional** with live data! Here's what I built:

### ✅ Core Features Implemented

1. **Live FPL API Integration** - Real player names, prices, teams (no API key needed!)
2. **Team Builder** - Generate optimal 15-player squads within £100M budget
3. **Transfer Suggestions** - Find hot picks and differential players
4. **Current Gameweek Detection** - Auto-tracks the active gameweek
5. **Enhanced UI** - Professional interface with actual player data

## 🏃‍♂️ Start in 2 Minutes

### Terminal 1 - Backend
```bash
cd /Users/gabrieltang/Documents/fpl-points-predictor
python start_api.py
```

Wait for: `✅ Model loaded successfully` and `📅 Current gameweek: X`

### Terminal 2 - Frontend
```bash
cd /Users/gabrieltang/Documents/fpl-points-predictor/frontend
npm install  # Only needed first time
npm start
```

Browser opens to http://localhost:3000 🎊

## 🧪 Test These Features First

### 1. Dashboard (http://localhost:3000/dashboard)
- ✅ Shows current gameweek automatically
- ✅ Displays top 5 players with real names (e.g., "Haaland", "Salah")
- ✅ Shows teams (MCI, LIV) and prices (£12.5M)

### 2. Team Builder (NEW! http://localhost:3000/team-builder)
- Click "Generate Team"
- Get a complete 15-player squad
- See total cost, predicted points, and remaining budget
- All within £100M and FPL rules!

### 3. Transfers (NEW! http://localhost:3000/transfers)
- **Hot Picks tab**: Best value players (high points per £M)
- **Differentials tab**: Low-owned gems to gain an edge

### 4. Gameweek Predictions (http://localhost:3000/gameweek-predictions)
- Auto-loads current gameweek
- Shows full table with names, teams, positions, prices
- Sort by predicted points

## 🔍 Quick Tests

### Test 1: Is the API working?
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/gameweek/current
```
Should return: `{"success": true, "data": {"current_gameweek": 22, ...}}`

### Test 2: Are predictions showing names?
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/predict/top-picks/22?limit=3
```
Should show player names like "Haaland", "Salah", not "Player 123"

### Test 3: Can I build a team?
Open http://localhost:3000/team-builder and click "Generate Team"
