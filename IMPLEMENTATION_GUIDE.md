# FPL Predictor v2.0 - Implementation Guide

## 🎉 What's Been Built

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive upgrade to your FPL Points Predictor, transforming it from a proof-of-concept into a **fully functional FPL management tool** with live data integration!

---

## 📋 Summary of Changes

### 1. **Live FPL Data Service** ✅
**File**: `api/services/fpl_data_service.py`

A robust data service that fetches and caches live FPL data:
- ✅ Player metadata (names, teams, positions, prices, availability)
- ✅ Current gameweek detection
- ✅ Fixture data with difficulty ratings
- ✅ Team composition validation
- ✅ Budget validation (£100M limit)
- ✅ Player search by name
- ✅ 60-minute cache to reduce API calls

**Key Features**:
- No authentication required - FPL API is completely free!
- Singleton pattern for efficient resource usage
- Comprehensive player metadata including injuries and suspensions
- Automatic opponent and fixture difficulty lookup

---

### 2. **Enhanced Model Service** ✅
**File**: `api/services/model_service.py`

Updated to integrate live FPL data into predictions:
- ✅ Automatic fixture lookup for predictions
- ✅ Returns player names instead of IDs
- ✅ Includes team, position, and price in responses
- ✅ Shows availability status and ownership percentage
- ✅ Filters by position and price
- ✅ Smart opponent detection for each gameweek

---

### 3. **New API Endpoints** ✅

#### **Gameweek Endpoints** (`api/routes/gameweek.py`)
- `GET /api/v1/gameweek/current` - Auto-detect current gameweek
- `GET /api/v1/gameweek/all` - Get all gameweeks with deadlines

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Start the Backend

```bash
# From project root
cd /Users/gabrieltang/Documents/fpl-points-predictor

# Activate your virtual environment (if using one)
# source .venv/bin/activate

# Start the API server
python start_api.py
```

**Expected Output**:
```
🔄 Initializing FPL data service...
Fetching fresh bootstrap data from FPL API...
✅ Bootstrap data loaded and indexed
Indexed 623 players, 20 teams
✅ FPL data service initialized
🔄 Loading ML model...
✅ Model loaded from /path/to/models/lgbm_enhanced.joblib
📊 Feature columns: 45
✅ Model loaded successfully
📅 Current gameweek: 22
```

Visit http://localhost:8000/docs to see all API endpoints!

---

### Step 2: Start the Frontend

```bash
# In a new terminal
cd /Users/gabrieltang/Documents/fpl-points-predictor/frontend

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start React app
npm start
```

Browser will open to http://localhost:3000

---

### Step 3: Test Each Feature

#### ✅ **Dashboard**
1. Should automatically show current gameweek (e.g., "22")
2. Top picks should display real player names like "Haaland", "Salah"
3. Should show team names (MCI, LIV, etc.)
4. Prices should be displayed (£12.5M, £13.0M, etc.)

#### ✅ **Gameweek Predictions**
1. Auto-loads current gameweek on page load
2. Change gameweek number and click "Get Predictions"
3. Table shows:
   - Real player names
   - Team names
   - Position badges (color-coded: FWD=red, MID=green, DEF=blue)
   - Current prices
   - Predicted points
   - Recent form
   - Recommendations

#### ✅ **Team Builder** (NEW!)
1. Select gameweek and formation
2. Click "Generate Team"
3. Should create a 15-player squad:
   - Total cost ≤ £100M
   - Correct positions (2 GKP, 5 DEF, 5 MID, 3 FWD)
   - Max 3 players per team
   - Shows predicted points for squad
   - Displays fixtures for each player

#### ✅ **Transfers** (NEW!)
1. **Hot Picks Tab**:
   - Shows players with best value (pts/£M)
   - Sorted by value score
   - Color-coded ratings (Excellent, Good, Fair)
   - Shows ownership percentages

2. **Differentials Tab**:
   - Shows low-owned players (<5% ownership)
   - High predicted points (≥4 pts)
   - Perfect for gaining mini-league edges

## 🔧 Configuration

### Backend Configuration
The FPL data service caches data for 60 minutes by default. To change:

```python
# In api/services/fpl_data_service.py
fpl_service = FPLDataService(cache_duration_minutes=30)  # Change to 30 min
```

### API Rate Limiting
The FPL API has no official rate limits, but we use:
- 60-minute cache to be respectful
- 0.5s delay when fetching individual player histories

---

## 📊 Data Flow

```
FPL Official API (free, no auth)
         ↓
FPLDataService (caching layer)
         ↓

         ↓
FastAPI Routes (REST endpoints)
         ↓

## 💡 Key Implementation Details

### 1. **No Payment Required**
All data comes from the free, public FPL API at:
- `https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/bootstrap-static/`
- `https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/fixtures/`
- No API keys, no authentication, completely free!

### 2. **Smart Caching**
- Bootstrap data (players, teams) cached for 60 minutes
- Fixtures cached for 60 minutes
- Reduces API calls while keeping data fresh
- Cache automatically refreshed on expiry

### 3. **Prediction Integration**
The ML model now receives:
- Real opponent names from fixtures
- Actual fixture difficulty (1-5 scale)
- Home/away status
- Player availability (injuries, suspensions)

### 4. **Team Building Algorithm**
Uses a greedy algorithm to:
1. Sort players by predicted points per £M (value)
2. Select players respecting:
   - Budget constraint (£100M)
   - Position requirements (2-5-5-3)
   - Max 3 per team rule
3. Prioritizes required players (if specified)

### 5. **Transfer Suggestions**
Analyzes:
- Predicted points difference
- Price difference
- 5-gameweek projection
- Value score (pts per £M)
- Provides "Highly Recommended", "Consider", or "Not Recommended"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Model not loaded" error
**Solution**: Ensure you have a trained model at `models/lgbm_enhanced.joblib`

### Issue: "No historical data found for player X"
**Solution**: This player wasn't in your training data. The API will skip them gracefully.

### Issue: Frontend shows "Failed to load predictions"
**Solution**: 
1. Check backend is running on port 8000
2. Check CORS is configured (already done in `api/main.py`)
3. Open browser console for detailed error

### Issue: Empty predictions list
**Solution**: Some players may not have historical data in your training set. This is normal. The system only predicts for players with past performance data.

---

## 📈 Next Steps

### Immediate Improvements
1. **Add Error Boundaries** - Better error handling in React
2. **Loading States** - Show skeletons while data loads
3. **Player Photos** - Add profile pictures (available from FPL API)
4. **Filters** - Add position/price filters to predictions page

### Future Features
1. **User Authentication** - Save personal teams
2. **Historical Tracking** - Track prediction accuracy
3. **Price Predictions** - Forecast price changes
4. **Captain Selection** - AI-powered captaincy advice
5. **Chip Strategy** - When to use Triple Captain, Bench Boost, etc.
